7. **postCreateCommand Support** âœ…
   - Implemented: Automatic execution of postCreateCommand after container creation
   - Supports field name conversion by parser normalization (postCreateCommand â†’ post_create_command)

8. **Go Environment LSP Detection Issue** âœ…
   - Fixed: Added Go binary paths (/usr/local/go/bin, /go/bin) to PATH for LSP detection and execution
   - Temporary fix: Until environment-specific devcontainer.json support is implemented

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority

9. **Debug Commands Cleanup**
   - Review and clean up debug commands added during development
   - Remove obsolete/redundant commands and consolidate remaining ones
   - Impact: Code maintainability and plugin size reduction

10. **Neovim Help Documentation**
   - Add Neovim help documentation (doc/devcontainer.txt)
   - Update development workflow to maintain help docs alongside README
   - Impact: Better user experience following Neovim plugin conventions

11. **Performance Optimization**
   - Parallel LSP server detection
   - Docker operation caching
   - Reduction of unnecessary Docker calls

12. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Proper error messages when Docker is not running

## External Plugin Integration Detailed Design

### nvim-test Integration
Currently, test plugins like `klen/nvim-test` and `vim-test/vim-test` execute commands in the local environment, but devcontainer environments require the following integration:

**Implementation Approach:**
- Hook/override test plugin command execution
- Automatically execute within container when container is running
- Example: `:TestNearest` â†’ `docker exec container_id go test -run TestFunction`

**Target Plugins:**
- `klen/nvim-test`
- `vim-test/vim-test`
- `nvim-neotest/neotest`

### nvim-dap Integration
Debuggers also need to run within containers, requiring:

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Auto-modify DAP adapter configuration for container execution
- Debug port forwarding
- Debugger startup within container

### General Command Execution Integration
Other plugins can be integrated using similar patterns:

**Design Pattern:**
```lua
-- API for plugin integration
devcontainer.integrate_command_plugin({
  plugin_name = "nvim-test",
  command_patterns = {"Test*"},
  wrapper_function = function(original_cmd)
    return devcontainer.wrap_command(original_cmd)
  end
})
```

This functionality provides developers with a complete development experience within devcontainers.

## Environment-specific Configuration Design Improvements

### Current Problem
Currently, environment variables (PATH, GOPATH, etc.) for postCreateCommand execution are hardcoded in the plugin, requiring individual support for each language.

### Proposed Improvements

#### 1. Environment Variable Specification in devcontainer.json
```json
{
  "name": "Go Project",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/go:1-1.23-bookworm",
  "postCreateCommand": "go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest",

  "customizations": {
    "devcontainer.nvim": {
      "postCreateEnvironment": {
        "PATH": "/home/vscode/.local/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/go/bin:$PATH",
        "GOPATH": "/go",
        "GOROOT": "/usr/local/go"
      },
      "execEnvironment": {
        "PATH": "/home/vscode/.local/bin:/usr/local/go/bin:/go/bin:$PATH"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Language-specific Presets
```json
{
  "customizations": {
    "devcontainer.nvim": {
      "languagePreset": "go",  // go, python, node, rust, etc.
      "additionalEnvironment": {
        "CUSTOM_VAR": "value"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Execution Context-specific Settings
- `postCreateEnvironment`: Environment for postCreateCommand execution
- `execEnvironment`: Environment for DevcontainerExec execution  
- `lspEnvironment`: Environment for LSP-related command execution

### Implementation Benefits
- Remove language-specific hardcoding from plugin
- Allow users complete control over environment
- Easy support for new languages
- Comply with standard devcontainer.json extension patterns
